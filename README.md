# Daily-Planner-App

## Description

Given a Daily Planner App Project, I used JavaScript to make a Daily Planner application where you can organize your working day with things you have to do. At the end of the day all data getting cleared.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this Daily Planner App, open the website link, click on any time block you need, write your task, and then click on the save button to save the task. If you need to remove one task or insert another, click on a specific time block erase or add another task and click save again. Even if you refresh the page or close and open the page the tasks you saved will still appear there till the end of the day.
